## Market Data Analysis

### Overview
This project is a comprehensive analysis of a financial market dataset, focusing on preprocessing, visualization, and predictive modeling. The objective is to explore various machine learning algorithms to predict stock prices and evaluate their effectiveness.

### Process Workflow
The project consists of the following phases:

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
    - Initial dataset modifications to refine the data.
    - Visualizations through various plots to understand data patterns and distributions.
    - Noise detection using several plots and removal to improve data quality.

2. **Modeling:**
    - Implemented multiple machine learning models to predict stock prices.
    - Explored Linear Regression as a baseline model. However, it suffered from overfitting, making it unsuitable for this dataset.
    - Experimented with XGBoost, a powerful ensemble method. Initial results were unsatisfactory, but hyperparameter tuning significantly improved performance.
    - In this version of the project (Version. 0.0) just Linear Regression and XGBoost tested which was not really successful.

3. **Challenges and Future Plans:**
    - Despite enhancements through tuning, the model's results remain suboptimal.
    - This is the Version 0.0 of the project, laying a strong foundation for future iterations.
    - The next steps involve further exploration of other models, feature engineering and advanced optimization techniques to achieve better predictions.
